% University of Amsterdam master thesis title page
% LaTeX Template
%
% Version 1.2 (14/02/14) (fixed cursive mode under titlepage)
%
% This template was made for the UvA by Ludo Nieuwenhuizen
%
%
% Instructions for using this template:
%
% I've done my best to make this template self-explanatory. The only thing (apart from
% finishing your thesis) is that wherever you see the percentage sign after some LaTeX
% commands, you have to insert some text (except for this
% introductory part, of course)l this is also explicitly stated.
%
% This title page can be compiled as is. This is not useful for
% including it in another document. To do this, you have two options:
%
% 1) Copy/paste everything between \begin{document} and \end{document}
% starting at \begin{titlepage} and paste this into another LaTeX file where you
% want your title page.
% OR
% 2) Remove everything outside the \begin{titlepage} and \end{titlepage} and
% move this file to the same directory as the LaTeX file you wish to add it to.
% Then add \input{./titlepage_master_thesis.tex} to your LaTeX file where you want your
% title page.
%
% The layout is quite vulnerable for changes. If you for instance remove the logo at the
% bottom, the last line 'Department Research institute...' will get higher up the page. In this
% case it is safer to insert a blank image or fix it in a different way.
%
% Any questions can be sent to me (L.G.Nieuwenhuizen@gmail.com)
